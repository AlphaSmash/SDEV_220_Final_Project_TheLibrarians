# SDEV_220_Final_Project_TheLibrarians
Final Project for SDEV220 Ivy Tech

Project Concept

Our project is designed for operation in a non-profit small library setting.  We have found a database of books and created a test database of members.  These databases are set onto an Excel workbook.  We will program our system to interact with different levels of activity within the library system to utilize these databases.  Some of what we are planning includes but is not limited to:
Querying books by Author and or Title
Querying members by member Id, or member name and address
Reporting of catalog status
Reporting of member late status
Sending of book receipts when borrowed 
Adding/deleting members and books from database
Creating levels of user access to our system
Creating a friendly and comfortable user experience
